Securefact Website Mock-up
2017
This mock-up is the final iteration that was delivered to the client for approval. With their requests and must-haves in mind, I aimed to deliver a website that was clean, easy to read, and approachable. Using Wordpress and Divi Themes, I then translated this design into a functioning website.

OCC Website Mock-up

One of my earliest professional mock-ups, I was tasked by Media Rez Studios to generate a potential mock-up for the Oakville Chamber of Commerce, who needed to modernize their website.

Social Enterprise Alliance
2017
This screenshot is one of a collection of websites that were dedicated to multiple chapters of the Social Enterprise Alliance. Each website was designed to be functionally the same, with small variations and tweaks depending on the particular client. I have designed these websites for SEA Chicago, LA, and Washington.
