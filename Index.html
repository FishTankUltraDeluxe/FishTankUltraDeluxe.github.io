	<p id="boxTitle0">Securefact Website Mock-up</p>
	<p id="boxYear0">2017</p>
	<p id="boxDesc0">This mock-up is the final iteration that was delivered to the client for approval. With their requests and must-haves in mind, I aimed to deliver a website that was clean, easy to read, and approachable. Using Wordpress and Divi Themes, I then translated this design into a functioning website.</p>

</div>

<div id="group1" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle1">OCC Website Mock-up</p>
	<p id="boxYear1">2014</p>
	<p id="boxDesc1">One of my earliest professional mock-ups, I was tasked by Media Rez Studios to generate a potential mock-up for the Oakville Chamber of Commerce, who needed to modernize their website.</p>

</div>

<div id="group2" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle2">Social Enterprise Alliance</p>
	<p id="boxYear2">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc2">This screenshot is one of a collection of websites that were dedicated to multiple chapters of the Social Enterprise Alliance. Each website was designed to be functionally the same, with small variations and tweaks depending on the particular client. I have designed these websites for SEA Chicago, LA, and Washington.</p>

</div>

<div id="group3" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle3">Suzie Sunshine</p>
	<p id="boxYear3">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc3">This website is designed to deliver information to parents about Suzie Sunshine’s variety of books and music on classical musicians, and to provide locations for book ordering and pickup. The website is designed to reflect the fun and engaging material she strives to provide to the children she teaches.</p>

</div>

<div id="group4" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle4">Golf Sr. Group Shot</p>
	<p id="boxYear4">2015</p>
	<p id="boxDesc4">Every week, the photographers at Appleby College Summer Camps was required to capture a group shot of each camp before the week’s end for promotional materials and to be displayed on a slideshow on Friday for the campers to enjoy. This photograph I took is a particular favourite of mine, as I believe it showcases the quirky fun that is had at the camp.</p>

</div>

<div id="group5" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle5">Contact Show Print #2</p>
	<p id="boxYear5">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc5">The second photo in a series of 3, this photograph was an exploration in lighting the face, specifically the eyes. This series was printed and showcased at the Scotiabank Contact Show at OCAD U.</p>

</div>

<div id="group6" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle6">Back-Yard Spider</p>
	<p id="boxYear6">2014</p>
	<p id="boxDesc6">Taken as an exercise in macro-photography, I’m particularly pleased with the clarity of the photograph, given that the subject – this spider – was less than 1cm across.</p>

</div>

<div id="group7" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle7">Inkjet Project #1</p>
	<p id="boxYear7">2015</p>
	<p id="boxDesc7">The first in a series of photographs, this particular image was captured using acrylic ink, a fish tank, some white illustration board, a plastic syringe, and a high shutter speed. I experimented with different timings, colors, and lighting scenarios, and later revisited this project in video form.</p>

</div>

<div id="group8" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle8">Appleby College Summer Camps</p>
	<p id="boxYear8">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc8">This motion graphic was created for Appleby College to use as a bookend graphic on their promotional videos. To accomplish this, I vectorized their logo, and then split each component into their own individual layers in Adobe Illustrator before taking each layer into After Effects and generating the motion using masks and motion paths. To view as a video, please check my About section for a link to my YouTube Channel.</p>

</div>

<div id="group9" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle9">MEC – Intro Remaster</p>
	<p id="boxYear9">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc9">This clip is a remastering of the original bookend motion graphic for the Marketing Equipment Company. The goal was to take the existing motion graphic and upscale it to modern resolutions, while also revitalizing the motion itself to give it a more lively appearance. Most assets were provided to me to work with. To view as a video, please check my About section for a link to my YouTube Channel.</p>

</div>

<div id="group10" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle10">TU20 Intro Graphic</p>
	<p id="boxYear10">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc10">This intro graphic was created using assets I also developed for a group called Tech Under 20, a youth meetup group dedicated to helping students integrate themselves into the tech, business, and entrepreneurship community. To view as a video, please check my About section for a link to my YouTube Channel.</p>

</div>

<div id="group11" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle11">Little Magic Loop</p>
	<p id="boxYear11">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc11">A simple animated loop of a character I designed as a method of familiarizing myself with character animation in Adobe After Effects.</p>

</div>

<div id="group12" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle12">CD Cover Mock-Up</p>
	<p id="boxYear12">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc12">This mock-up was part of a media package that would have been sent to Massive Tank Studios, a recording studio, by Media Rez Studios. The idea was to generate sample covers for CD’s that could be used to exemplify what MRS was capable of, however this project was ultimately canceled as other projects came to the forefront.</p>

</div>

<div id="group13" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle13">OHIP Redesign Mock-Up</p>
	<p id="boxYear13">2018</p>
	<p id="boxDesc13">Created for an assignment as a part of my studies at OCAD U, this project tasked us with redesigning the cramped OHIP registration form. We were required to include everything that was on the original form, and were also tasked with making it into a fillable PDF.</p>

</div>

<div id="group14" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle14">The Smiley Dictionary</p>
	<p id="boxYear14">2017</p>
	<p id="boxDesc14">This is a snapshot of a layout project completed as part of my education at OCADU. We were provided with a set of copy which we were then required to arrange in a typographic layout using Adobe Indesign. We were required to utilize all formating that the source document included, and to communicate with our 'client' if we spotted any potential errors or isssues in the copy.</p>

</div>

<div id="group15" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle15">TreeScout Reimagining</p>
	<p id="boxYear15">2018</p>
	<p id="boxDesc15">Another assignment from OCAD U, this project saw us choosing one work from a number of designers and researching the concept of “messy design” in conjunction with redesigning the work. What I found was that messy design is iterative design, and that design as a whole is not a linear process. The final result is indicative of the process taken to get there, and by practicing explorative techniques something greater than the initial concept can be created.</p>

</div>

<div id="group16" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle16">Glass Mesa Design Logo</p>
	<p id="boxYear16">2015</p>
	<p id="boxDesc16">For about 1 year I decided to try my hand at freelance work, and I learned a lot about how to find work and manage my time. As a part of this process, I generated my own branding, Glass Mesa Design, a name inspired by a piece I had created prior to beginning my schooling at OCAD U. I was aiming for something that was clean, simple, and very lightweight.</p>

</div>

<div id="group17" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle17">XarvCom Logo</p>
	<p id="boxYear17">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc17">This logo was designed for a small competition start-up called XarvCom. It would have been a competitive drone sport, in a similar vein to the VEX Robotics Competition. The goal here was to create something that was representative of some aspect of a drone, which led to my choice of a drone propeller serving as one half of the X form.</p>

</div>

<div id="group18" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle18">Unique Geek Business Card</p>
	<p id="boxYear18">2017</p>
	<p id="boxDesc18">This business card was developed for a start-up IT servicing business. They did not have a logo at the time, so I did double-duty and developed the wrench and type-mark for them as well.</p>

</div>

<div id="group19" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle19">PowerTeam Halton</p>
	<p id="boxYear19">2017</p>
	<p id="boxDesc19">Powerteam Halton is a meetup of business professionals and entrepreneurs who meet weekly to simply chat and discuss their week in business and offer help, advice, or encouragement. I offered to design a logo and branding materials for them to use on their website and to spread the word to grow the group even more.</p>

</div>

<div id="group20" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle20">TU20 Branding Materials</p>
	<p id="boxYear20">2016</p>

<div id="group21" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle21">Illustrative Character Explorations</p>
	<p id="boxYear21">2015</p>

</div>

<div id="group22" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle22">Laptop Skin</p>
	<p id="boxYear22">2014</p>
	<p id="boxDesc22">This simple design was created in Adobe Illustrator to be used as a laptop skin, which I still use to this day.</p>

</div>

<div id="group23" class="lbTextDB">

	<p id="boxTitle23">Doughnuts</p>
	<p id="boxYear23">2016</p>
	<p id="boxDesc23">This graphic was created as a part of a set for a motion graphics assignment at OCAD U. The task was to create a title sequence for a theoretical film adaption of a novel. I chose to ‘adapt’ a book called Company by Max Barry.</p>
