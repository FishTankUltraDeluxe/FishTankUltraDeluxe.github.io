		<p>Games as a medium are vast. They cover a broad range of themes, methods of interactivity, and genera, and allow for the player to interact with them in a variety of ways.</p>

		<p>Gender representation has, until recently, remained largely unchanged. It is only within the past few years that there has been a very, very small shift in focus to bring more female characters into the spotlight who are portrayed positively in gaming.</p>

		<p>In 2018, the number of male-to-female lead characters in games with a pre-established, non-customizable protagonist was estimated to be roghly 4:1.
